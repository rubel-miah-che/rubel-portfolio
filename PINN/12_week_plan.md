# 12-week condensed plan (for PINN prototype)

Weeks 1-2: Math & PDE foundations (calculus, linear algebra, 1D diffusion/advection).
Weeks 3-4: Python & data (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), build FD solver for 1D heat equation.
Weeks 5-6: ML basics & PyTorch (train small MLPs; autograd demo).
Weeks 7-8: PINN basics: implement a tiny PINN from scratch; run DeepXDE example.
Weeks 9-10: Domain & spatial: nitrate transport PDE, sample covariates, QGIS basics.
Weeks 11-12: Build PINN for nitrate (1D â†’ 2D prototype), validation, MC-dropout UQ.
