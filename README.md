# Rubel Miah — Chemical Engineering Portfolio

## About Me
I am an M.Sc. student in Chemical Engineering at BUET with hands-on industrial experience in operating and optimizing hydrogen peroxide production units. I have a strong foundation in mass transfer, diffusion modeling, environmental assessment, and plant troubleshooting. Skilled in Aspen HYSYS and MATLAB, and currently developing expertise in Python, data handling (NumPy, pandas), and machine learning for environmental applications.  

My research interests include process modelling, environmental remediation, radiological risk analysis, and using machine learning to predict and map nitrate leaching from agricultural soils. Finalist, Nature-Based Future Challenge (2024). Seeking research-focused opportunities (Research Associate / Graduate Researcher) where process modelling, experimental design, and environmental risk assessment are key.
